If you're still experiencing issues with your Vue.js code, especially regarding the `showDefaultText` variable not updating correctly, there are a few things we can try to troubleshoot and fix the problem:

1. **Ensure Proper Data Declaration:** Make sure that `showDefaultText` is declared in the data section of your Vue component. This ensures it's reactive and its changes are tracked by Vue's reactivity system.

   ```javascript
   data() {
     return {
       showDefaultText: true,
       // ... other data properties
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Method-Based Event Handling:** Instead of directly modifying `showDefaultText` in the template, consider using methods. This provides more control and makes the code easier to debug.

   ```javascript
   methods: {
     handleFocus() {
       this.showDefaultText = false;
     },
     handleBlur() {
       this.showDefaultText = true;
     },
     // ... other methods
   }
   ```

   And update your template accordingly:

   ```html
   <select
     id="plumeCompleteness"
     v-model="selectedValue"
     @change="applyFilter"
     class="form-control adjustable-box"
     style="margin: 0; padding: 5px; margin-top: 4px"
     @focus="handleFocus"
     @blur="handleBlur"
   >
     <!-- options -->
   </select>
   ```

3. **Debugging with Console Logs:** Add console log statements in your methods to ensure they are being called correctly. This can help you understand if the events are triggering as expected.

   ```javascript
   handleBlur() {
     console.log("Blur event triggered");
     this.showDefaultText = true;
   }
   ```

4. **Check for Other Interfering Scripts:** Sometimes, other scripts or Vue directives might interfere with the expected behavior. Review your component and parent components for any potential conflicts.

5. **Update Vue and Browser Check:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Vue and that your browser is up to date. Sometimes, compatibility issues can cause unexpected behavior.

6. **Use Computed Properties:** If the display of the text depends on `showDefaultText`, consider using a computed property. Computed properties are more efficient and are automatically updated when their dependencies change.

   ```javascript
   computed: {
     displayText() {
       return this.showDefaultText
         ? `Plume Completeness: ${this.selectedValue}%`
         : `${this.value}%`;
     }
   }
   ```

   And in your template:

   ```html
   <option v-for="value in rangeValues" :key="value" :value="value" class="form-option">
     {{ displayText }}
   </option>
   ```

Try these steps and see if they resolve your issue. If the problem persists, there might be something else in your broader codebase affecting this behavior.
