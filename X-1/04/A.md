I apologize for the oversight in my previous responses. While the code I suggested should work in theory, there might be other factors affecting the `showDefaultText` variable's behavior. To pinpoint the issue more accurately, could you provide additional context?

1. **Framework**: What JavaScript framework (e.g., Vue, React, Angular) are you using? This will help understand the specific way data reactivity and event handling are managed.

2. **`showDefaultText` Definition**:  How is `showDefaultText` defined in your component's data? Is it simply a boolean, or could there be other logic modifying its value? Please share the relevant code snippet.

3. **`rangeValues`**: What does the `rangeValues` array contain? It's possible an interaction between the `v-for` loop and the `blur` event is affecting `showDefaultText`.

4. **`applyFilter` Function**: Does your `applyFilter` function modify `showDefaultText` or any data that might indirectly affect it?

5. **Browser and Console**: Have you checked your browser's developer console for any error messages related to this component? Errors might offer clues about unintended side effects.

Please provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist in finding the root cause and a suitable solution. 

Additionally, if possible, consider creating a minimal reproducible example showcasing the issue. This would help isolate the problem and eliminate any external factors that might be contributing to the unexpected behavior.
