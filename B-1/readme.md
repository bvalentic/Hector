Single-Sided Instruction Following Evaluation 
(Mix of coding/non-coding prompts)

Overview
When working with Large Language Models, we generally want them to be able to follow instructions. That is, we want them to be able to do the things that we ask them to do.

In this project, you will be looking at a given Prompt and Response pair from a user.

Each Prompt should be an Instruction-following prompt - that is, it should give some requirements that the model has to follow in its output.

You will be checking whether each of those requirements has been met, and you will then rate overall how well the Response fulfilled the Prompt.


You will see each requirement on its own round and will use the arrows at the bottom to move through the rounds for each requirement.

There will be a variable number of requirements presented on each task; many will have only one (1), but some will have more. The task page will tell you how many rounds there are.

You will go through each round and then answer how well the Response replied to the Prompt overall.

Steps
Overview with Screenshots!
For each Response, you will first determine if it can be rated in this task. If you mark that it cannot be rated, you will pick a reason and then submit.

This question is at the top right. It will only show up with the first round.

If the prompt is not instructional, you should mark that the task cannot be rated.

Other prompts that should not be judged are those that include PII, make unsafe requests, or are not understandable (either for being gibberish or being out of scope).

You will then be presented with a question about whether the Response follows a specific instruction from the Prompt. This will show up at the top right of the page.

You will state whether the Response followed that instruction, and you will explain why (if it is trivial, your answer can be brief).

If a Response is a canned reply ("as an AI language model, I can't help with that"), please just reply No to every instruction.

There are also options to mark that the listed question isn't an instruction (or is broken) or that the instruction shown was not present in the prompt.

If there is more than one specific instruction to check, you will hit the > (right arrow) at the bottom of the page. It will say something like "Round 1 of 3" when you start.

Go through all the Rounds of specific instructions.

On the page with the last instruction, you will then rate how well the Response fulfills the instructions in the Prompt overall and you will explain your decision.

Submit!
